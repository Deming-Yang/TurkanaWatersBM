	abstract = {An accurate representation of the spatial distribution of stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in modern precipitation is required for many hydrological, paleoclimate, and ecological applications. No standardized method for achieving such a representation exists, and potential errors associated with previously employed methods are not understood. Using resampling, we test the accuracy of interpolated δD and δ18O estimates made using four methods. Prediction error for all methods is strongly related to number of data and will likely decline with the addition of new data. The best method lowers estimation error by 10–15\% relative to others tested and gives an average error, using all available data, ≈2.5\% of the global range. We present and interpret global maps of interpolated δD, δ18O, and deuterium excess in precipitation and the 95\% confidence intervals for these values created using the optimal method. These depict global and regional patterns, make evident the robustness of interpolated isotopic patterns, and highlight target areas for future precipitation sampling.},

The effects of seasonality on isotopic offset between precipitation and atmospheric vapour and the slope of the local evaporation line are described. Atmospheric feedback and its role in labelling the isotopic composition of the Laurentian Great Lakes and tropical lakes is discussed. Several important considerations are suggested to improve parameterization of quantitative paleoclimatic reconstructions including use of assumptions that are appropriate for the climatic setting, for the atmospheric feedback situation, for salinity, and headwater setting. Potential for use of dual-isotopes to trace past changes in seasonality and input, and a dual-lake index method that can potentially be used to trace connectivity of lakes are presented. In cases where modern or paleo-evaporation systems may be under-defined there are inherent limitations in the degree of quantification that can be attained.},

	abstract = {Lake Turkana, in northwestern Kenya, is a closed-basin, alkaline (pH = 9.2) lake of moderate salinity (TDS = 2500 ppm). Principal ions are Na+, HCO−3 and CI−. The lake is essentially polymictic in the northern basin and little compositional variation occurs in surface waters. The Omo River is the principal influent, providing some 80–90\% of water input to the lake. Chloride has an apparent accumulation time of about 2500 years after accounting for burial of interstitial water. The bottom sediments are predominantly detrital and fine-grained, yet mineral-water reactions are very important for the geochcmical budget. Ca2+ is precipitated as calcite; Na+ is removed as an exchangeable cation on smectite; Mg2+ is probably incorporated into a Mg-silicate phase, most likely poorlycrystalline smectite, as it enters the lake water; K+ may be used in illite regradation. Cation exchange is a very important process in the mass balance of this lake. Over 40\% of incoming Na is removed as an exchangeable cation. After cation exchange and interstitial water burial, Na has a response time of 2650 years, which compares favorably with that of chloride. These processes seem to occur rapidly within the water mass of the lake: other reactions may be important in regulating interstitial water compositions. Several changes occur in the upper 3m of sediment: interstitial-water pH drops to 8.3 and alkalinity increases slightly with depth, SO2−4 decreases slightly, and amorphous silica saturation is approached. These changes are a response to organic matter oxidation and the dissolution of unstable silicates rather than a reversal of reactions occurring in the lake water. High rates of sedimentation (up to 1 cm per year) may minimize the effects of diffusion between the interstitial waters and the lake water, although burial of interstitial water assumes considerable importance.},

These high values are well documented; however, the climatic processes responsible for the isotopic anomalies in Ethiopian waters have not been thoroughly investigated. We use isotopic data from waters and remote data products to demonstrate how different moisture sources affect the distribution of stable isotopes in waters from eastern Africa. Oxygen and deuterium stable isotopic data from 349 surface and near-surface groundwaters indicate isotopic distinctions between waters in Ethiopia and Kenya and confirm the anomalous nature of Ethiopian waters. Remote data products from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis project show strong westerly and southwesterly components to low-level winds during precipitation events in western and central Ethiopia. This is in contrast to the easterly and southeasterly winds that bring rainfall to Kenya and southeastern Ethiopia. Large regions of high equivalent potential temperatures (θe) at low levels over the Sudd and the Congo Basin demonstrate the potential for these areas as sources of moisture and convective instability. The combination of wind direction data from Ethiopia and θe distribution in Africa indicates that transpired moisture from the Sudd and the Congo Basin is likely responsible for the high isotopic values of rainfall in Ethiopia.},

	abstract = {Stable carbon (δ 13C) and oxygen (δ 18O) isotope measurements in lacustrine ostracodes are widely used as paleolimnological indicators of past climate change. Previous work has used individual ostracode valves to resolve seasonal and subdecadal paleohydrological signals, yet replicated assessments of co-occurring specimens from modern samples are rare. Here we focus on ostracodes from sediments collected in 1979 from Lake Turkana, an alkaline desert lake in tropical eastern Africa. Sourced from the Ethiopian highlands, the Omo River is the dominant inflow into this lake. We present individual ostracode valve analyses (IOVA) of δ 13C and δ 18O measurements (n = 329) of the extant benthic ostracode Sclerocypris clavularis from 17 sites spanning the entire lake (navg = ∼19 specimens/site). We demonstrate that the pooled statistics of individual valve measurements at each site are shaped by lake hydrology, superimposed over inter-individual isotopic variations. Within-site variance in IOVA-δ 13C is larger (∼60\%) than that of IOVA-δ 18O. Yet, site-based averages exhibit a systematic pattern, with higher δ values toward the southern part of the lake, away from Omo River inflow. We suggest that the latitudinal δ 13C gradient may arise from low riverine δ 13C and low organic matter δ 13C as a productivity response to nutrient-rich Omo River inflow toward the north. The δ 18O pattern may be explained by the diminishing influence of Omo River inflows and more evaporation driving higher IOVA-δ 18O values toward the windier, southern basin. We conclude that pooled IOVA statistics in Omo-Turkana sediments can aid interpretations of past regional paleohydrology and its variability in this basin.},

We apply our new dataset to a stable-isotope-based evaporation model that explicitly incorporates downwind lake effects, including humidity build-up and changes to the isotope composition of atmospheric vapor. Our evaporation estimates are consistent with previous mass transfer results for Michigan, Huron, Ontario and Erie, but not for Superior, which has a much longer residence time. Calculated evaporation from Superior is {\textasciitilde}300 mm per year, less than previous estimates of {\textasciitilde}500 mm per year, likely arising from integration of the ‘isotopic memory' of lower evaporation rates under cooler climatic conditions with greater ice-cover than the present. Uncertainties in the estimates from the stable-isotope-based model are comparable to mass transfer results, offering an independent technique for evaluating evaporation ﬂuxes.},

Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a random-effects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients.},

	abstract = {The isotopic compositions of oxygen (δ18O) and hydrogen (δ2H) are widely used to locate the geographical origin of biological remains or manufactured products. In this paper, we analyse the distributions of δ18O and δ2H in tap waters sampled across France, and in precipitation interpolated with the Online Isotopes in Precipitation Calculator and modelled with the isotope-enabled ECHAM6-wiso model. Our aim is to provide isoscapes usable in archaeology and forensics and evaluate whether the modelled data could be surrogates for measured ones. The δ18O and δ2H in the 396 tap waters sampled varied spatially within a range of 10‰ and 77‰, respectively. Their consistent distributions followed rules summarized by the effects of altitude and distance from the coast. Their variations along the year were small. Therefore, the database provides a solid reference for δ18O and δ2H of the water supply system at the regional scale. The areas with the most uncommon oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions (Atlantic coast south of Brittany and the highest elevations in the Alps) are the most accurately traceable areas in provenancing studies. The isotopic compositions of modelled precipitation have the same spatial distributions but different absolute values from those of tap waters. Therefore, our results favour the use of statistical isoscapes rather than general circulation model-based isoscapes in provenancing studies.},

	abstract = {Different water sources exploited for public use have different exposure to risks associated with climatic and environmental change. Isotope ratios of tap water have previously been studied as a potential tool to link public supply waters with water source characteristics at local to continental scales, providing information on the footprint of and potential risks associated with the water sources used. Work that combines intensive spatial and temporal sampling with independent water management data has been limited, however. In this study, an extensive observation network was established during 2014–2016 to provide monthly tap water sampling across China. We show that the spatial distribution of annual mean tap water isotope ratios is generally consistent with that of local precipitation across China. We identify seasonal correlation between tap water and precipitation isotope ratios in south China, where use of surface water is prevalent. In contrast, relatively invariant tap water isotope ratios elsewhere in China, which are not correlated with seasonal variation of precipitation isotope ratios, can be attributed to use of groundwater or water from river basins with longer storage times. The tap water isotope signatures identified here could be widely applied to characterize water supplies and associated sustainability challenges in different regions worldwide.},

	abstract = {The D/H ratio of epicuticular plant waxes (δDwax) preserved in sedimentary archives is a powerful tool for paleoclimate reconstruction, but comparisons to other proxy records or to climate model simulations requires a proxy system model (PSM) that accounts for transformations between δDprecip and δDwax. Here we present a new, publicly available PSM for plant waxes, WaxPSM. WaxPSM predicts δDwax from observational data or any isotope-enabled modern, paleo, or future climate model experiment. δD values of the C29 n-alkane are calculated based on precipitation or soil water δD and observed apparent fractionation values, adjusted for plant-type differences. Using WaxPSM, we assess three key uncertainties in δDwax records: the degree to which variations in δD may reflect changes in vegetation rather than climate, structural uncertainties that arise from limited water isotopic observations, and the impacts of land cover change on climate reconstructions during the Last Glacial Maximum and the Preindustrial period. Parametric and structural uncertainties can cause δDwax variations up to 50‰, but in most cases, the differences are ∼10–30‰. The drier subtropics are additionally impacted by the incorrect structural assumption that plants' source water, δDsoil, is isotopically similar to the climate variable of interest, δDprecip. We recommend a coordinated, systematic effort to elevate observational constraints on δDprecip, δDsoil, and the δD of multiple compound classes, which would dramatically reduce parametric and structural uncertainties and allow further complexity to be built into the model.},
