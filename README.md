# TurkanaWatersBM
# Bayesian approach for modeling Lake Turkana water isotopes

## Software requirements

The code was developed in [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) using [R (v. 4.3.2)](https://www.r-project.org/) calling [JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/), a program for Bayesian hierarchical models. Please install all of the above before using this notebook. 

## Usage

Open `TurkanaWatersBM.qmd` in RStudio. The Quarto notebook loads all packages, runs all MCMC simulations, and produces several plots. Model code and sensitivity tests are provided as JAGS scripts in R.
