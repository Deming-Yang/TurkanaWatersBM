## Software requirements
The code was developed in R (ver. 4.3.1) calling the standalone JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler) program, which is required before the code can be run. The JAGS program can be downloaded via [this link](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/). Please make sure to download the version that is appropriate for your operating system.

To call JAGS from RStudio, the R packages "R2jags" is also required.

Other R packages specified in the file headers help to visualize data.
