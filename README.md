# TurkanaWatersBM
# Bayesian approach for modeling Lake Turkana water isotopes

## Software requirements

The code was developed in R (v. 4.3.2) calling [JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/), a program for Bayesian hierarchical models. Please install JAGS before using this notebook.

## Usage

The Quarto notebook loads all packages, runs all MCMC simulations, and produces several plots. Model code and sensitivity tests are provided as JAGS scripts in R.
